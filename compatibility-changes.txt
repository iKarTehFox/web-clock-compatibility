You are using the compatibility variant of web-clock! Here's a list of important changes that were made to work with pre-ES6 browsers.

Bootstrap:
- Downgraded Bootstrap v5.3.3 to Bootstrap v4.6.2
- Now requires jQuery
- Removed tooltips
- Converted all components to be compatible with Bootstrap 4
- Removed dark mode toggle

JavaScript:
- Added core-js library (includes polyfills for ES6 and up)
- Transpiled all JS code (except Luxon) to be compatible with ES5

Iconify and Bootstrap Social CSS:
- Removed completely

Favicon
- Converted .svg icons to 32x32 .ico

Known issues:
- Bootstrap accordions don't close as expected when other cards are opened
- Bootstrap radio button selections don't clear as expected (vice versa when importing settings)
- Color Fade mode may fail to disable sometimes
- Certain fonts may fail to render on old browsers (system incompatibility, NOT website!)
- Files are slightly larger (especially new core-js code) and may take longer to download
